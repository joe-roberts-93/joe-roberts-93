I'm passionate about solving technical problems, and love to take on new challenges - in fact, it's the main reason I swapped careers, from communications to coding.

- 👷‍♂️ Full stack developer, having built three MVPs.

- 🔧 Experience in **React, Ruby on Rails, Next.JS, and more**.

- 💼 I'm currently **working as a developer** while building personal projects you'll see here to further my professional development

- 🏃‍♂️ Offline, my hobbies include running, swimming, exploring Montréal, and learning new things
